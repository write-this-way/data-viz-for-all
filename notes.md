DATA VIZ FOR ALL

Julia Smith (Inst. for non profit news), Aaron Williams (washington post), Nathaniel Lash (tampa bay times)

How is the planning process different when planning for mobile
Williams: How the reader will come to the project. Where is the reader, as a mobile reader?
Lash: Once you know you are working for mobile, you're working with a new set of abilities. What you show the reader right off the bat is what they are going to get.

How do you make it go both ways (mobile and desktop)?
Lash: Stop doing charts that don't work on mobile. Design within the confines.
Williams: Mobile is a gift in some ways. Forces us to focus on what we are trying to show people. Focus first on what matters, for mobile. Consider desktop as progressive enhancement.
Smith: Choose design patterns that work on both.

How does it change the storytelling process? What approaches work best?
Williams: Performance is a feature.
Julia Smith: ScrollMaster.js

How should audience accessability factor into this work?
Smith: Keep the fringe users in mind. Make sure you have good contrast levels. Color blind safe. Make sure you can tap through an interface.
Williams: Use aria attributes to implant data within your visualizations
Lash: Using senses to convey data in other ways

How do you deal with resistance within your organization?
Smith: Show them the analytics that mobile traffic is important.

Best practices?
Williams: Develop on your phone. Use BrowserSync to be building on the phone at the same time as the desktop.
